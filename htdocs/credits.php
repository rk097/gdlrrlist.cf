      <h1>Credits</h1>
      <p>Congrats! You found a hidden page! Good for you. Here I, ryan, would like to credit some people who helped with development, either directly or indirectly.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>jack L. Taught me everything I know, and built the skeleton of the new JS-ified site.</li>
        <li>stadust. A fantastic developer, and the developer of the pointercrate demon list. He made the jquery script for resizing the video thumbnails, I pretty much tweaked a couple things and then copied it. Oh and, before you start yelling at me for being a plagiarist, pointercrate is MIT licensed, and I asked him if it was ok. He said yes.</li>
        <li>Vink & Xan. Shitty list owners, who kindly gave me their code for their leaderboards, which allowed me to make the pop ups.</li>
        <li>Necolas, or whoever the guy that made <a href = "https://www.github.com/necolas/normalize.css" target = "_blank">this</a> is. This is what allowed the site to look as clean as it is today. Thanks.</li>
        <li>w3schools. Fantastic site for quick HTML and CSS tutorials.</li>
        <li>nik. He taught me about MongoDB, which either that or firebase is something I'm going to implement in the future.</li>
      </ul>
