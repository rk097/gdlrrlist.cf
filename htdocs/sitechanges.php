              <p dir="ltr">Introducing performance points version 2! The original point system was something that I just came up with no actual logic, because I didn't expect that anyone would actually care. But this list has grown quite a bit since then, and now people actually do care, so its time for a rework!</p>
              <p dir="ltr">Now that the number of list demons has exceeded 150, we are now cutting the list at 150 and have re-implemented the legacy list.</p>
              <p dir="ltr">Removed the about button, the logo in the top left instead takes you to the homepage.</p>

              <p dir="ltr">Along with that, ssamosa211 also integrated the 61+hz list into the site after months of me being too busy to do it myself.</p>
              <p dir="ltr">The site is now on GitHub as well! For any of you like ssamsosa211 who want to contribute to the development of the LRR List, you now can easily do so by visiting the <a href = "https://github.com/rk097/gdlrrlist.cf" target = "_blank">GitHub Repository</a>. From now on I will be updating this rather than the repl.</p>
