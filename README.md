This is the OLD VERSION (php-setup frontend-based) of the full code repository for the LRR List website. Have a look around! This one is very simple to clone, so if you're looking for a quick-and-dirty setup for your own list, this is probably what you're looking for

The CURRENT VERSION (nodejs ejs setup backend-based) is on a new github repository, made by hpsk. Link to it is [here](https://github.com/gdhpsk/gdlrrlist)

For anyone interested in making a fork of this repository for your own custom list, without all the hoops of running a fork of Pointercrate:
- Click on the Run on Repl.it button
- setup your site by modifying homepage.php and filling in the desired details, and then modifying mainlist.json, extended.json, legacy.json, leaderboard.json, and levellist.json to fit your list 
- delete any undesired files.
