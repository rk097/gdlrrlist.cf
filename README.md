This is the full code repository for the LRR List website. Have a look around!

For anyone interested in opening a pull request for a js or css file:

Please modify the `?v=` tag in each of the php files (scripts/*.php) that your file is referenced in to the current date of your pull request, thanks.

This repository will be continually updated as time progresses, the main thing being backups of the website json databases every 2 weeks or so. Because of that the JSON files may not necessarily be up to date but everything else should be.
